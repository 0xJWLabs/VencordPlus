- Right-click a role in a user profile, then choose the View Members in Role option

In servers where:

- you do not have any moderation permissions (Members tab doesn't show on top left);
- and member count is above 100.

some limits apply:

- Offline members won't be listed;
- Up to 100 members will show. Scroll down in the member list to get more.
- However, friends will always be shown, regardless of their status.
