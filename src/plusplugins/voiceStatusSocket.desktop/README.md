# VoiceStatusSocket plugin

Sends your voice channel status to other apps that want to see or edit (mute, deafen) your voice channel status.

I was going to do this over D-Bus but Vee told me I can't do that (I assume because it will require importing stuff in native space)

## Use case

I'm building a plasmoid that shows your current voice channel in your panel.

## Usage
- Enable this plugin
- Get something that uses the status exposed by this plugin
- ???
- Profit™️

## Extra credits

This plugin was partially made by copying the XSOverlay plugin
