## **PlatformSwitch**
This plugin enables individuals to switch their platform. With this plugin, users have the flexibility to change their platform to a range of options, including **PS5, Mobile, Web, and Desktop**.

If you choose the **PS5** platform, each time you launch an application with a presence, your profile will show "Playing on PS5," accompanied by a PS5 logo and a "Connect to PlayStation Network" button below. 

Users equipped with the **PlatformIndicator** plugin will have the capability to view the platform designated by this plugin.

## **Contact Information**
